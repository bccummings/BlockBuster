Welcome to the repository for the game BlockBuster - a sandbox for experiments in the Unity game engine. The main purpose of this exercise is to learn more about Unity and other associated technologies (Blender, C#, etc.). If the game ends up looking nice or being moderately entertaining, that's a bonus!

At it's core, the game centers around the most basic of childhood games - build a block tower, and try and knock it over. Advanced features such as individual soldiers, complex terrain, and prebuilt castles come later. In it's most simple state, the game will consist of two game modes:

1. **Construction mode:** the player can place blocks in three dimensions using an editor window.
2. **Battle mode:** the player takes control of a cannon and tries to knock down their castle in as few hits as possible. 

Currently, development is focused around the implementation of these two modes. Future ideas will be tallied via the Issues tab above.
